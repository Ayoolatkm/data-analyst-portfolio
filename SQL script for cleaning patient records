-- 1. Remove duplicate records
DELETE FROM patients
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(id)
    FROM patients
    GROUP BY name, date_of_birth, email
);

-- 2. Standardize date formats
UPDATE appointments
SET appointment_date = STR_TO_DATE(appointment_date, '%d-%m-%Y')
WHERE appointment_date LIKE '%-%-%';

-- 3. Remove NULL or empty values
DELETE FROM patients WHERE email IS NULL OR email = '';

-- 4. Trim whitespace in text fields
UPDATE patients
SET name = TRIM(name),
    email = TRIM(email),
    phone = TRIM(phone);
