-- SQL Queries for NHS Patient Wait Time Analysis

-- 1. Calculate individual patient wait times
SELECT patient_id, appointment_date, arrival_time, seen_time, 
       TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, arrival_time, seen_time) AS wait_time_minutes
FROM nhs_wait_times
WHERE appointment_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';

-- 2. Average wait time per hospital
SELECT hospital_name, AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, arrival_time, seen_time)) AS avg_wait_time
FROM nhs_wait_times
GROUP BY hospital_name
ORDER BY avg_wait_time DESC;

-- 3. Identify patients who waited over 4 hours
SELECT patient_id, hospital_name, arrival_time, seen_time, 
       TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, arrival_time, seen_time) AS wait_time_minutes
FROM nhs_wait_times
WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, arrival_time, seen_time) > 240;

-- 4. Analyze peak wait time hours
SELECT HOUR(arrival_time) AS hour_of_day, 
       AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, arrival_time, seen_time)) AS avg_wait_time
FROM nhs_wait_times
GROUP BY hour_of_day
ORDER BY avg_wait_time DESC;

-- 5. Compare wait times by age group
SELECT CASE 
         WHEN age < 18 THEN 'Under 18'
         WHEN age BETWEEN 18 AND 40 THEN '18-40'
         WHEN age BETWEEN 41 AND 65 THEN '41-65'
         ELSE '65+' END AS age_group, 
       AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, arrival_time, seen_time)) AS avg_wait_time
FROM nhs_wait_times
GROUP BY age_group
ORDER BY avg_wait_time DESC;
